<h1> This is a project from my React course.</h1> 

- Everything is done using React without Redux. 
- Features like adding products to the cart, increasing/decreasing product quantity, calculating the total price, removing products and so on are all fully implemented. 
- However, I'm unable to handle the functionality of the 'Continue Shopping' button.
